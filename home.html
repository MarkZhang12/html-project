        <h1>2017 Korean Hockey Tournament</h1>
        <p>In the winter of 2017, I participated in the Korean Hockey Tournament as a member of the Hong Kong Typhoon Selects Hockey team. We won the tournament, and I tallied 5 goals and 4 assists adding up to a total of 9 points in the span of 5 games. </p>

        <h1>See You Again</h1>
        <p>One of my favorite songs is “See You Again” by Wiz Khalifa. (ft. Charlie Puth). I like this song because it has a catchy rhythm and the overall style of the song just suites my taste in music. The track was commissioned for the soundtrack of the 2015 action film "Fast &amp; Furious 7", as a tribute to the actor Paul Walker. He died in a single-vehicle accident on November 30, 2013, in Valencia, California.</p>

        <h1>NBA 2K20 MyTEAM</h1>
        <p>My favorite game mode on NBA 2K is called MyTEAM. It allows users to build their dream team using MT (MyTEAM currency) to buy their ideal players. My current lineup has involved: Steph Curry (GOAT), Kevin Durant (GOAT), Giannis Antetokounmpo (GOAT), Larry Bird (GOAT) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (GOAT). GOAT means that the player has 99 in every single statistic. This lineup costs 5.4 million MTs in total!!!</p>
