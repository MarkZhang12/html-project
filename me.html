        <h2>Hockey</h2>
        <p><img src="images/portrait.jpg" class="float_left" width="460" height="283" alt="" />My name is Mark Zhang, and I was born on March 12th, 2006, in Shenzhen, China. I started playing hockey at the age of 8 and ever since then, it has been my favorite sport. My first contact with the sport of hockey was during the summer of 2013, and ever since then. I have proved myself as one of the most talented people out there. I constantly dominated my age group and competed with older players. I was playing in the U12 league at the age of 10, and became the top scorer with 53 points in 18 games, averaging 2.94 points a game. Within a few years I have become the best player in China in my age group, and it was time for a bigger stage. As a result in 2017, I came to Canada, a place where the world’s best junior hockey players compete. As of now, I am playing for the Toronto Young Nations, an AAA team (highest division possible for juniors) and my goal is to move on to the next big stage, the OHL.</p>

        <h2>Game</h2>
        <p>I don’t consider myself a hardcore gamer, but I extremely enjoy the pleasure of gaming. My favorite games are sports games because I feel connected to the characters. I love game modes that allow users to put the best players in history all on one team, something every sports fan has imagined, and in a video game, this can become a “reality”. With the game modes provided, we can take a glimpse of what a team with such caliber can do. It is a really interesting feature that I will never get tired of.</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>Music is an indispensable part of my life. It brings life and color into our world. Strangely enough, as much as I am fond of listening to music, I absolutely despise playing an instrument. I played viola in middle school, and it is an experience I never want to look back at. My fingers had to move at light speed in order to keep up with the ever changing notes, and the music that came out sounded like a dying pig.  I enjoy listening to music because it helps me prepare myself mentally. As an example, if I am preparing for a hockey game, playing motivating music will get my adrenaline rushing; when studying, calming music will help me focus on my work.</p>
